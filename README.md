# 📊 College Event Feedback Analysis
# Data Science & Analytics Task 3 – Future Interns Internship Project

Transforming student feedback into actionable insights!
This project demonstrates how data science can improve campus event planning by analyzing real or simulated feedback from college events such as 
workshops, seminars, fests, and training programs.

## 🌟 Project Overview
College events generate tons of valuable feedback — but this data often goes unused.
This project leverages pandas, TextBlob/VADER, and data visualization to uncover:

- Student satisfaction trends
- Sentiment from open-ended comments
- Events with the highest and lowest ratings
- Common suggestions for improvement
- Department-wise event performance

The goal is to help colleges make informed decisions and plan better, more engaging events.

## 🎯 Objectives
This project covers the full data-science workflow:

✔️ Data Preparation
- Importing Google Form CSV data
- Cleaning inconsistent or missing values
- Standardizing ratings and text columns

✔️ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Summary statistics of event ratings
- Comparison across departments and event types
- Trend identification using grouped visualizations

✔️ Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Applying TextBlob or VADER to extract sentiment polarity
- Classifying feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative
- Understanding the emotional tone behind ratings

✔️ Visualization
- Creating clean, insightful charts such as:
  - Bar charts
  - Pie charts
  - Histograms
  - Word clouds
  - Sentiment distribution graphs

✔️ Final Insights
- Providing data-backed recommendations to improve:
  - Event organization
  - Speaker quality
  - Student engagement
  - Logistics and communication

## 🧠 Skills Gained
By completing this project, you will develop industry-ready skills:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing using pandas
- Sentiment analysis (TextBlob / VADER)
- Visual storytelling with matplotlib & seaborn
- Word cloud generation
- Correlation analysis for survey insights
- Working in Google Colab for reproducible workflows
